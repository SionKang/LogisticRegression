# LogisticRegression
implementation of logistic regression framework through Python

In this program, it explores an aspect of machine learning called logistic regression. Using the sample data "Logistic" that has an two x-variables of real numbers and y-variable of either 0 or 1, the program aims to predict the relationship between the x and y. The data was split into training data and testing data to do so: training set used to find optimal parameters theta0, theta1, and theta2 of the linear equation called the weighted sum, testing set used to compare accuracy between actual output and predicted output. Instead of using the logistic regression class provided by Spyder, the mathematical process was thoroughly outlined hand by hand. This is reflected from the mathematics done in code of the sigmoid function, logarithmic-loss, and the cost function. To further understand the mathematics behind the simple linear regression, refer to the "LogisticRegressionReport" file.
